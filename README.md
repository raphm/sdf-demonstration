# Signed Distance Field Rendering Demonstration

This is a very simple demonstration of how to render the
signed distance field texture generated by [makeglfont](https://github.com/raphm/makeglfont).

## Signed Distance Fields

Among other uses, signed distance fields allow a simple GLSL shader to
recover a vector-like representation of a shape from a bitmap of
values. This makes them very useful for rendering fonts in OpenGL
video games. A small (e.g., 512 by 512 pixel) bitmap holding an SDF
representation of a glyph can be smoothly scaled with no pixelation
and with very little perceptible loss in quality. A full discussion of
the why and what of signed distance fields can be found on [krytharn's
YouTube presentation][kyp] or in [Valve's original paper][vop].

## Usage

Make sure your web browser is WebGL-capable.

Start the server with:

```
node server.js
```

Connect your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/ .

Use 'w' to move the text as close to you as you like. Notice that the
bitmap from which the text is rendered (visible at `mensch.png` in the
source tree) is quite pixelated when zoomed up to an equivalent size.

SDFs allow you to do fun things like adding glowing borders to your text.
Use the 'g' and 'h' keys to enable and disable a blue glowing border for the
text. (There are other ways to do this, of course, but this is a nice
side effect of using SDFs for text.)
